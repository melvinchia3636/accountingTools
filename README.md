## The Problem

Accounting exercises often involve repetitive tasks of preparing books, journals, ledgers, and financial statements manually or using scattered Excel files. Most platforms are either too generic or not designed for structured academic practice‚Äîespecially those aligned with UEC syllabus standards.

## The Solution

AccEditor is a curated tool that mimics the layout of accounting documents based on UEC accounting curriculum structure, while simplifying the bookkeeping process for students, teachers, and exam preparation. Inspired by real past-year papers and modular topics, it provides a digital environment to manage:

- Petty Cash Books
- Ledgers
- Journals
- Statements
